OBJECTIVES:
You are  in a maze of high-voltage fences. There are also some interceptor robots that will try to destroy you.
If you touch the maze or any of these robots, that is the end of the game.
The robots are destroyed when they touch the fences or when they collide with each other.
Every time you move in any direction, each robot moves one cell closer to your new location, in whichever direction is the shortest path.
The robots will follow you!

MOVEMENTS:
The movement is indicated by typing one of the letters:
Q (Forward-left);W(Forward);E(Forward-Right);
A(Center-Left);S(Maintain the same position);D(Center-Right)
Z (Back-left);X(Back);C(Back-right)
You can't move to cells occupied by destroyed robots.
The above mentioned letters may be typed in uppercase or lowercase.
You have electrified posts (*) and non-electrified posts (+).
You can exit the game by typing CTRL - Z, in Windows, or CTRL - D, in Linux.
You lose when you are caught by any robot that is alive or you if you encounter an high-voltage fence.
You win when all robots are destroyed and you can go to one exit door (O)
